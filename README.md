# Internet of Things Project 
## Wine Cellar Control System

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design and implement an IoT control system for a wine cellar. The system aims to independently monitor the temperature level, air humidity, and air quality of the cellar. In case of deviations from ideal conditions, the system will take immediate actions to restore and maintain the optimal environment for wine storage.

## Features

- **Temperature Monitoring:** Constantly measure and monitor the temperature within the wine cellar.

- **Humidity Control:** Independently assess and regulate the air humidity to ensure optimal wine storage conditions.

- **Air Quality Monitoring:** Monitor the air quality within the cellar to maintain a suitable environment for wine preservation.

- **Automatic Correction:** Implement mechanisms to automatically correct deviations from ideal conditions, ensuring minimal manual intervention.
